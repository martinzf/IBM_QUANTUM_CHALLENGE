# IBM Quantum Challenge

The 2024 IBM Quantum Challenge consisted of a series of exercises, mainly in quantum circuit transpilation, showing off the capabilities of Qiskit 1.0. This repository contains organised solutions to the various exercises.

If one wishes to use the notebooks, they must create a `token.txt` file in the root directory, containing their IBM Quantum API token.
